"1","rn444065080","I had a significant travel challenge during my 5 day visit to this hotel and the hotel could not have handled it better. Staff members, Chris and Jennifer went beyond my expectations. Chris was especially welcoming and remembered my name each time I saw him. Jennifer handled my difficult situation with professionalism and thoroughness.
The hotel itself was lovely. Common..."

Very clean, extremely restful and the most comfortable beds in the industry.
The staff will help with anything or leave you alone if you need sanctuary. How they know when to do what? Good training and good..."

"4","rn443358012","Upon arrival, staff is friendly and helpful, and the lobby is inviting - nice scent, warm fire, modern decor. There is an open bar area adjacent to lobby, and a very good Itlaian restaurant (Osteria Pronto) in the hotel as well. The hotel has another bar that adjoins as well as a fully stocked Starbucks upstairs toward meeting rooms. The..."
"5","rn442966592","The city views from the room are nice and the hotel staff is friendly. The Italian restaurant is really good - I highly recommend it for dinner. The hotel lobby bar (located on the right when entering) offers very tasty cocktails and the sports bar (located left from lobby when entering) is a good spot to watch sports on the..."
"6","rn442938164","We stayed here for the Big Ten Championship Game. The hotel is super modern with excellent restaurants. All of the downtown amenities like St. Elmo's etc. are a very short walk. The hotel is adjacent to the convention center and you can walk the entire way to Lucas Oil Stadium using indoor pathways. This has to be the best hotel..."
"7","rn442613202","Stayed here two nights during the Big Ten Championship game. Got to stay on the 31st floor, had beautiful view of the White River. My cousin also came along in his room had an awesome view of the baseball stadium and Lucas Oil Field. Beds were super comfy, shower was awesome, even had spray jets that also shot water out..."
"8","rn442268453","Stayed here for onsite seminar. Hotel is absolutely stunning, especially around this time of year, its all decorated. I had previously booked online, check in was the easiest I have ever experienced, staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms were clean and spacious.
Only downfall I had was the cost of the parking, beware...its costly!"
"9","rn442244537","Everything from the great service and great room with a great view. Nothing bad to report. The only thing I wish was that it was a little closer to the action, but that is what Uber is for. We have been staying primarily at the Omni for the last 4 - 5 years and are happy with the switch. We..."
"10","rn441510327","Stayed at the JW Marriott hotel in Indianapolis for a conference. The hotel is centrally located with lots of restaurants nearby as well as a large indoor mall. The hotel has great amenities and the rooms are current and clean. Beds are comfortable but pillows were very firm."
"11","rn441138764","If you want to have the best of the best then you should stay at this hotel in the heart of Indy. Great food, great service from all the employees and room staff could not have been any happier. Great Place!!!"
"12","rn441086327","We just stayed at the JW marriott for the second time for an on site convention. The second stay was as nice as the first two years ago. The hotel features nice clean large rooms and a very nice staff. The convention area is perfect. Enjoyed the in hotel Starbucks several times. We love the tunnel walk to the mall...."
"13","rn440905565","I stayed here in conjunction with an on-site convention. The staff were friendly and helpful. My room was not ready until late in the day which is always frustrating but the desk clerk comped my parking which I felt was more than fair. Overall very clean, well-appointed rooms and convenient location."
"14","rn440659535","Great stay at this downtown location. Easy walking to shopping, numerous museums, restaurants, sports venues and government complex. Room was comfortable, clean and views from the room were amazing. Full wall of glass. No issues with check-in or check out, however, next time we would do Valet parking. Valet was $45 and it was $40 to self park. Room Rate..."
"15","rn440469847","We recently stayed at the JW for our annual church conference and found it to be an enjoyable experience all around. The staff was courteous and very helpful.

"16","rn440152113","Stayed here for a weekend getaway on our anniversary. This is a very nice hotel located in the downtown area with a modern feel and a lot of amenities.
Checkin was great as Cindy took great care of us and even had champagne delivered to our room that night with a hand written card congratulating us on our anniversary. Very..."
"17","rn439558676","Big, modern, great service and breakfast in Concierge area. Comfortable beds and nice amenities. Long waits for elevators. Overall a nice stay. Pricey parking, but very convenient. Nice location for walking through Indy's downtown."
"18","rn439245965","Suddenly I'm attending conventions in Indy and most are at this hotel. After maybe three trips to Indy in twenty years, I'm here three times in 2016. Hotel is the center of the action for me here. Good spot. Sports bar has a fine burger and lots of TVs. I'd come back."
"19","rn438310424","This is hotel has the best location in downtown Indy with a building that towers above all others. I really appreciate waking up to the sun drenched east facing rooms on the high floors while being able to watch the sunset from the west side lounge. They have the best restaurants and a skyway that conveniently connects to the Convention..."
"20","rn438180093","I stayed here for business for about 3 to 4 days. The hotel itself, is very upscale and very inviting. The architecture, and the decorating, are simply beyond what most hotel chains have come up with. The service is impeccable, everyone is dressed appropriately, have the appropriate service skills, and are very interested in helping you. I did not run..."
"21","rn437932417","The people here are extremely nice. Very helpful. A few things I didn't like... First the ice machines are all on the 2nd floor. So you need to take the elevator down to get ice. They do offer to have someone run ice up to you if needed however. They do have free bottled water in the room so I..."
"22","rn437783337","I'd found that the JW Marriott Indianapolis is the 5th-best hotel in the US, according to Condé Nast Traveler Readers Poll. I pointed this out to students. Two separate students told me that they'd been to ""better"" hotels, even chains. After a few minutes' of discussion, it hit me. ""You mean free breakfast?""
I received exceptional service from each staff..."
"23","rn437103843","My husband and I visited the JW Marriott for a weekend. We were there for a business seminar which was held at another hotel but we paid the extra to stay at this 5 star hotel. He is a Marriot rewards member and we always try to choose Marriott. The hotel was at full capacity and we got there for..."
"24","rn435899934","Love this hotel. One of my favorite places to stay. My husband and I have stayed here 5 times over the past 4 years and will definitely be back. Very quiet, excellent service and great location! Lots to do within walking distance of the hotel! Love coming to Indy!"
"25","rn435591972","Five star hotel with good staff and good service. Good Elite lounge with breakfast, snacks and desserts at night.
My issue is with $40 parking fee. Ridiculus for parking in Indy. I parked at garage across the street ( across street from Convention Center). It was listed as $25 per day but even cheaper if you get event parking ticket..."
"26","rn435371175","I recently spent 4 days at the JW Marriott and it was a great stay with wonderful service. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are quiet. The front desk people are great- very concerned with the comfort of their guests. The convention was held on site and everything was really well done."
"27","rn435155592","Very nice hotel. Quiet. Beds are awesome. Service was good. Location is great. Feels fairly new. A little annoyed that self-parking is $40/night. That feels steep and a little bit like a gouge. C’mon Marriott… When you are charging $300/night for a $150 room, I think you could go with a little less on the self parking. And up on..."
"28","rn435088846","Very good location, walking distance to multiple restaurants, lively atmosphere and very good staff. The front desk experience with a ""new"" employee was excellent. Makes me believe staff are trained properly. Good smaller conference facility in the hotel and directly connected with safe walkways to the city's large conference facility right across the street."
"29","rn434945014","Very nice hotel overall with attentive front desk staff. But it's really overkill when, after you check in, they come around the desk and hand you your room key with two hands. It's not Japan and not needed."
"30","rn434928037","This is a magnificent place with the most amazing staff. Phil Ray the General Manager is an amazing gentleman. Go Try the food at High Velocity. Its the place to be in Indianapolis. Katie Ferreira and her staff at High Velocity are on top of the game. Do try the cocktails from Nikki or Heather."
"31","rn434861601","One of my favorites. I've stayed here 3 times in the past 3 years. Each time was great. They do attention to details very well. Today after the Monumental Marathon the had a tray of warm towels being handed out in the lobby. It was perfect! Great staff"
"32","rn434676588","The JW has excellent service, modern facility and well furnished, updated rooms. The hotel upgraded us to a wonderful room where we had ceiling to floor windows with beautiful views of the city. Great bedding & amenities. Had a huge fitness center that offered free headsets if you forget your own.
The one problem with the hotel was the lack..."
"33","rn434152822","I stayed at this hotel for an annual convention, and it was a great experience. Front desk staff are professional, courteous, and organized. I liked that the elevator requires using room key to access guest floors. I could easily walk to the convention in the ICC, and the mall using the skywalks. My room was so quiet, and I enjoyed..."
"34","rn433967203","Convenient to the convention center and downtown. Rooms are spacious, comfortable bed. Very good executive club lounge. One of the nicer JWs we have stayed in. Customer service was excellent from check in to bell stand to housekeeping, which included turn down service."
"35","rn433799473","Recently stayed 3 nights for a conference. Room was basic, no wow factor. With over 1100+ rooms it is a BIG hotel ion the outskirts of downtown. Housekeeping showed up after 530 pm. When I returned to my room to get ready for supper. Was using my electro is devices. Not happy. On a brighter note, conference food was decent...."
"36","rn433707684","Attending convention at Indiana Convention Center, the hotel is linked to the convention center, very convienent. Good sports pub on level one (Velocity) and ok Italian restaurant at the other end. Property feels newer or well maintained. Room nice but a little tight. Great work out and pool facility."
"37","rn433689376","I was in Indianapolis for a week for a conference at the JW Marriott. The day of arrival I received a call to let me know the JW Marriott was overbooked and I had to stay in a nearby Marriott the first night. The room in the JW was standard fair for a Marriott. What was exceptional was how well..."
"38","rn433349391","Beautiful lobby, helpful and quick front desk check-in, lovely room, comfortable beds, great lobby bar, impressive meeting space for the PRSA International Conference, spacious and modern hotel that helps make a great Indy impression on visitors and residents,"
"39","rn433344054","I want to express my compliment and gratitude to Courtney who served us at the bar during our annual conference. She juggled very well with great customer service!! She had quiet a vocal and loud group and she navigated so well and had everyone taken care of with their food & drinks. Thank you Courtney.
Best,
Larissa"
"40","rn432746835","Hotel was great. Very clean, spacing of lobby, restaurants, and bars were well thought out. Meeting rooms were a bit of a hike from the lobby and rooms but that was the only negative. Great staff, friendly and helpful. Catering did a great job!!"
"41","rn432740063","Overall, I had a pleasant experience for two nights past weekend. My room was on the 15th fl and the city view was pretty nice. Bed was super comfortable, room was very clean and organized (except the coffee machine, I recommend to use it just with water first for cleaning purpose). Staffs were well-trained and helpful. Also, Check-out via phone..."
"42","rn432420002","We arrived late and I was tired and grumpy. I had some trouble with my reservation as the whole city was full of future farmers! After some bumps in the road the front office manager fixed our reservation . We had one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in anywhere ! There was one pleasant surprise after another during..."
"43","rn432358781","Room was clean and bed was good or better. Front desk (and concierge) were terrific but restaurant service (both dining places) was weak. Also surprised that such a large hotel had such a poor lobby shop!"
"44","rn431904675","Beautiful, well-designed. Great service. Lovely and functional room. One of the best gyms and pools I've visited. Osteria Pronto is a great on-property restaurant. Full Starbucks on 2nd floor. Great conference hotel. Wonderful location -- next to both ballparks."
"45","rn431874999","I recently spent a night at this wonderful hotel. There is plenty to do at the hotel, in a city that has plenty to do already. The guest check in staff was very professional, the room was excellent and the experience in the restaurants, nothing short of superb. I will definitely stay here again."
"46","rn431854589","This is a nicely appointed and conveniently located conference hotel with a few glitches. The front desk staff is friendly, helpful, and welcoming. The housekeeping crew does a terrific job keeping the busy place clean. There are great views in every direction, from what I could tell.
Now, to the concerns. Parking is ridiculously expensive. I've paid less at luxury..."
"47","rn431365189","Stayed here with a friend in December 2015 for the Big Ten Championship Game. Hotel was very close to Lucas Oil Stadium so I did not have to rent a car. All of downtown Indianapolis was a zoo of people that weekend but this place is awesome! The volume of people did not faze them so check in was smooth..."
"48","rn431273006","First they didn't call me when my room was ready so I had to go back. Second, the elevator system requiring a key card doesn't always work, and I rode the elevator for 10 minutes before someone else's key card worked. Third, the cleaning staff cleared my room service but just neglected to clean the room. I can't wait to..."
"49","rn431157226","We were here on a conference. The WIFI was excellent. The place was very clean and bright. The Gym was a great layout and had all excellent work out stations. The rooms were clean and comfortable. There is lots of great eating places all around this hotel. We found a great Thai Restaurant just a few blocks away. Indianapolis downtown..."
"50","rn430523094","Nice spacious room. Clean, comfy and good conference pricing. They gave me the wrong room first and quickly correctes the error. They got me checked in at 10 AM and made me feel welcomed. I would come back if I am in the area again. Great room with a view."
"51","rn430388336","We spent one night at the JW Marriott just to see if it merited the accolades it has received since opening in 2012. We stayed on the 27th floor that featured commanding views of downtown Indianapolis. Nothing in our room or the corridors exhibited age. The room and bathroom was immaculate. Large hi-def TV worked perfectly. This appears to be..."
"52","rn430265168","Very nice hotel. Over 1000 rooms so it's big. Clean rooms. Great food and beverage options. A little pricey on room cost. I'd stay here again. Easy skywalk access to the convention center. Staff was very friendly, helpful and professional."
"53","rn429870142","I stayed here for one night for a conference and was very impressed by the facility. I didn't get a chance to enjoy the bars or restaurant because our meals were part of the conference. That said, 700 people attended the conference and the food was very good. A wonderful breakfast buffet with an oatmeal bar, fruit, muffins, bagels, etc...."
"54","rn429374041","1st class service! Everyone was helpful, kind and professional. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Here for a business conference, but would recommend to traveling friends. Awesome breakfast buffet and extra friendly staff!"
"55","rn429303924","This hotel is in a large complex, located close to downtown Indianapolis. Stadiums, museums, park, government offices, NCAA offices, and restaurants are all within walking distance. Other Marriott properties are in the same complex. The exercise room is very large with plenty of equipment. My only complaint is the ""gift shop"" is tiny; I had to walk to another nearby..."
"56","rn429258078","We had a corner room with a view! The room was spacious and very modern. The bed was very comfortable unfortunately the pillows were crappy. They had 2 types but they were soft and small. The bathroom was fantastic; there were 3 shower heads! The shower was also huge! When we ordered room service they didn't serve it on a..."
"57","rn428997505","JW Marriott has great service with very helpful staff and concierge. A little confusing in that there are 3 Marriott hotels in a few block radius of each other in downtown area. So be sure to tell the cab/shuttle driver which downtown. The JW food was very good, sports bar area was busy but had almost every major college football..."
"58","rn428851688","Wonderful property, upscale, modern, and comfortable rooms. Connected to convention center, and in heart of Downtown, yet close enough to airport. My ""go to"" stay when on business in Indy, and would look forward to staying for pleasure as a getaway destination. Outstanding views, and fantastic Concierge Lounge."
"59","rn428806743","The JW Marriott is a Hotel that offers 1st class service and makes your stay feel like home.
We had room on 23 rd floor great view of indy, room was spacious and clean, we had access to lounge on 31st floor which was a great place for breakfast and just to sit around.
Hotel is 5 minutes from shops..."
"60","rn428735951","This hotel was my 3rd of 4 in 10 days, and the only one to meet ALL of my expectations. The staff were first rate--every single one of them. The lobby is gorgeous. The bar (nicely kitted out with an alcohol fireplace) was humming, since there were several conferences at the hotel where people knew each other. I had a..."
"61","rn428036334","I attended a conference at this hotel in October. The Go Express shuttle was only $10 from the airport to the hotel and a 20 minute ride; it dropped me off at the front door of the hotel. I found the front-desk staff to be very professional and friendly. Chris was especially helpful and personable, answering all my questions during..."
"62","rn428022810","My husband and I had a quick stay here during a road trip from Boston to the Midwest, and were very happy with this hotel. It is bright, clean, modern and the staff very welcoming. The room was well appointed, the walk in shower a bonus, and having a full service restaurant and bar on site makes a one night..."
"63","rn427809300","Very professional and friendly staff. Great amenities, and a fitness center that is top notch. Rooms are very clean, and spacious for a downtown hotel. We opted for self parking which is located under the hotel $40.00 per night, valet parking is $45.00 per night. Big city parking is always expensive, so be sure to budget that into your stay...."
"64","rn427754806","I came here for a conference and everything went well. The room had all the amenities one would expect from such a big hotel. Big clean rooms, friendly staff, great restaurants.
Right after my arrival I needed assistance with some heavy equipment and they send two guys from engineering who spent a good 10 minutes helping me out but they..."
"65","rn427591109","I booked a room well in advance of staying here on my wedding night. When we arrived, around 1 am, they said they were out of rooms. Considering that I was standing with my wedding dress on and my husband in his tux, I wasn't worried that they wouldn't find something. Of course, they got us a room with a..."
"66","rn427533776","Excellent service with a pretty city view from room. The bed was comfortable but other room amenities do not compare to the Conrad which is another five star hotel two blocks away.
The JW is very convenient to the Zoo, NCAA Headquarters, Museums, and is attached to convention center (as are a number of hotels), a short walk to Lucas..."
"67","rn427463155","Conveniently located within a few blocks walk to state Capitol, Lucas Staium, Indiana University, shopping mall, and Convention Center. Hotel rooms are contemporary, sleek, clean and comfortable but not generous in space. Plush mattress allows a great rest. 24th floor room has a panoramic view of across the entire city. Staff friendly and helpful. On promise are 2 restaurants (Italian..."
"68","rn427444833","Stayed here and attended a conference in same hotel. This is a very nice property. I really enjoyed my room and all it's space. Front desk folks were some of the nicest and friendliest I had ever dealt with. This is a great hotel, great location to Lucas stadium and baseball stadium. And if you are downtown it is easy..."
"69","rn427106394","Stayed here for wedding anniversary and had a great stay. Very clean and updated. Great view during the day but especially at night. Our room had floor to ceiling window. Nice lively bar with great drinks. The only disadvantage is the location but still in walking distance of the city center
One of the best in downtown Indy!"
"70","rn426805063","Room was nice, bed was comfy. As expected for a premium Marriott (and rate that goes with it). This met expectations, but no bonus points. Finishes in the hotel are gorgeous (the wood in the elevators!). My big disappointment was service, specifically the parking/valet experience. I pulled in and was told I could self park at a public garage across..."
"71","rn426462900","Had lunch in the sports bar, High Velocity. Ate at the bar. The bartender, Eric, was awesome - very friendly, great service. Food was excellent. Great place to watch football on a Sunday afternoon - lots of TV's. Eric went out of his way to put the game we wanted on the TV behind the bar."
"72","rn426413748","Nice clean hotel. The architecture is quite unique and boxy, but interior is nice. Staff is intetnational. Get high floor room if you can. The restaurant is also nice. Rooms are slightly smaller than other Marriotts but good."
"73","rn426386235","Check-in staff went out of their way to welcome and quickly get us through the process. Room was clean and modern. On site food was good and reasonably priced. Internet service was fast enough for video. I do wish one could find Coca Cola products on site."
"74","rn426140499","Hotel rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly. I've been coming to this hotel regularly for the last year. The sports bar in the hotel has very good bar food, plenty of televisions and a friendly staff (Eric and Quinten never fail to be excellent hosts)."
"75","rn425891145","I only stayed at this JW for one day, but I was really impressed by its customer service.
At check in, I asked for a quiet, high floor room and I was given a room on the 29th floor far away from the elevator. :)
I will definitely stay here again when I visit Indianapolis in the future."
"76","rn425885394","High class service, the room was clean and modern!
Full of professional and helpful stuff, they greet you and really helpful whenever you need them. The breakfast buffet was great, great selection of food, helpful staff, thoughtful services, they asked me if I need one more coffee to take out with me before I leave."
"77","rn425323132","This Hotel has everything and is very classy. Help is everywhere if you need it and I would recommend anyone to stay here! The gym is very nice, and the pool is small but sufficient considering it is on the 2nd floor. Views from the upper rooms are great as well."
"78","rn425171616","Eric at High Velocity Bar is amazingly great! He provides high class service and he is friendly and attentive! Wonderful experience. Everyone should try it out! Wonderful bartender. Great location, comfortable and relaxing"
"79","rn424792963","Probably one of best hotels in midwest, or at least Indianapolis. We have stayed here two times. The lobbay staff is so very helpful, and our room has been excellent.
We have eatten in restaurant and in the ballrooms for events. Both have excellent, delicious food. The bar staff has been great. Some people may like having Starbucks on the..."
"80","rn424750148","I travel 80+ nights per year and always stay at Marriott properties. This JW is by far one of the nicest hotels I stay in, period.

I would highly recommend this hotel when visiting..."
"81","rn424653541","Staff go out of their way to make sure guests are happy with their stay. We've been on many business trips, but this hotel is by far the best we've ever stayed in. The hotel is only about three blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium and we were able to catch a Colts game while we were there. Hotel is also..."
"82","rn424537067","Located across the street from Victory Field the J.W. also gives you quick access to Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the Colts. It is also a good place for business meetings which was the reason I was in town. Terrific staff who greets you warmly and helps you at every turn. It's not a cheap place to stay but if..."
"83","rn424529771","I am a hotel nob. I like 4 or 5 star only. This is a great hotel, the best in Indy. The bar has the best pizza and the italian rest, has lasagna ever. Don't stay anywhere else.
The best place to stay in Indy."
"84","rn424503216","My husband and I stayed here this weekend as a get away.
The Pros:
Lobby very welcoming and nice, requested a high floor received the 26th with a beautiful view, food at the Italian restaurant was great,
The Cons:
Need more staff-anytime I called the front desk and asked for anything it was as if I was bothering them; I..."
"85","rn423920552","I love the JW but one aspect of this hotel fell short. Check in smooth, room + view were beautiful, fitness center is top notch ... BUT the valet service failed me not once, but twice. They are horrible. And at $45 plus tips ... I'll think I'll skip this hotel next trip in Indy. I called for my car..."
"86","rn423639787","Our stay at the JW Marriott was incredible from the time we walked in to the moment we left. We first talked to Mika who checked us in. She was kind, personable, and helpful.

The view from my..."
"88","rn423336827","It's been a long time since I have been in up scale hotel that provides great service like this one. My first impression was at check in with Lynae. Her service attitude created a great start to my stay. I encountered over 20 different employees in my 3 days, there was not a weak or poor experience with any of..."
"89","rn423321263","No surprise this is a good quality hotel, it's huge with a lot of rooms and restaurants and excellent facilities which explains why so many conference organisers choose it as a venue. I've been 3 times and it's been busy each and every time. It's not a huge issue however the bars tend to be a bit full and noisy"
"90","rn423229337","After several stays at the JW, it's definitely well-located with modern, well-furnished rooms. It's connection to the Conference Centre is a strong point if you're there on business. One minor complaint I have concerns the Concierge Desk. We stopped one evening to ask about some casual dining options downtown. The two young women at the desk looked at each other..."
"91","rn422887803","Visiting Indy for business downtown. The JW is my favorite place to stay when in town. Great location with fabulous decor and amenities.

"94","rn422542613","I attended the IPT Symposium at this hotel last week. The hotel is spacious enough to hold a large conference. The rooms are large and furnished to meet every need. The gym located on the 2nd was HUGE and had plenty of options for you to workout. The staff at the front desk is extremely attentive and helpful. This is..."
"95","rn422152523","Price a little steep but very good!! Waiters pleasant and knowledgeable. Also convenient since a family member stayed at the hotel and we received free parking from her company. This Resturant was also close to the Indianapolis Speedway and museum which we planned to visit."
"96","rn422106513","We live just west of Indianapolis, and when they built this hotel in 2011, my wife said she would love to stay here.

"933","rn219528367","The day we came in for our booking at the hotel, it was beyond busy and chaotic. So much so that the hotel had a difficult time getting rooms in order on time. Ours was three hours delayed. Initially, this was a disappointment as I've never had this issue before and normally service was top notch. This day, it seemed,..."
